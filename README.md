InverseVIs
==========
In the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the code used in the experiments from: 

>"Data-Driven Estimation in Equilibrium: An Inverse Variational Inequality Approach" by Dimitris Bertsimas, Vishal Gupta and Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis

A draft of this paper (to be updated) is available from [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3397.pdf).

At the present time, the repository is not in working order, mostly because many of the relative paths are incorrect.  I plan to reorganize some of the files and add some documentation soon.  Any pressing questions can be addressed by email to the second author above.
