InverseVIs
======

In the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the code used in the experiments from: 

>"Data-driven estimation in equilibrium using inverse optimization" by Dimitris Bertsimas, Vishal Gupta, and Ioannis Ch Paschalidis.  Mathematical Programming 153.2 (2015): 595-633.

This paper is available from [Mathematical Programming](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-014-0819-4) or the [Vishal Gupta's website](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~guptavis/research.html).  Traffic data used in the examples is taken from the [repository](https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks).

Also, if you use any portion of the software, I'd appreciate a quick note telling me the application.  As an academic, I like hearing about when my work is used and when it (hopefully) has impact.
